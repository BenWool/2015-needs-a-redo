Once upon a time


The mean professor, who is a Beaman Monster, made a class redo a homework exercise
The hero of this story is nowhere to be found
So the class organized a massive search party to find the hero to slay this Beaman Monster posing as the professor
Then Jake redid his assignment while watching Ip Man.
It's a cool movie if you're in the mood.
It's a Romantic Comedy about a Chuchunya from Moscow, and his adventures in NYC with a group of otherwise normal software engineers. 
This Chuchunya's name was Jeffrey, and he was so consumed by the Beaman monster that he devoted his entire Saturday to finding him.

The end.
