Once upon a time


The mean professor, who is a Beaman Monster, made a class redo a homework exercise
The hero of this story is nowhere to be found
So the class organized a massive search party to find the hero to slay this Beaman Monster posing as the professor
Then Jake redid his assignment while watching Ip Man.
It's a cool movie if you're in the mood.
Then more and more students, who were really Andean Wolves, began fixing their assignments.
Everyone joined in and watched the movie.

The end.
