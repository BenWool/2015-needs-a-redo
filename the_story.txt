Once upon a time


The mean professor, who is a Beaman Monster, made a class redo a homework exercise

 The professor made them redo the assignment because of a craxy Devil Bird threatened him to do so.
The professor was actually a sea serpent.
The hero of this story is nowhere to be found
So the class organized a massive search party to find the hero to slay this Beaman Monster posing as the professor
Then Jake redid his assignment while watching Ip Man.
It's a cool movie if you're in the mood.
Then more and more students, who were really Andean Wolves, began fixing their assignments.
Everyone joined in and watched the movie.

Randomly, a kappa came out of nowhere demanding 3.50 and disappeared.

Just then a group of ninjas burst in, all of whom were masters of shaolin shadowboxing and the Wu-Tang sword style.
"We're here to bring the ruckus!" they shouted.
But still the hero of the story was nowhere to be found.
The ninjas had pet sea serpents.
The ninjas walked away. All the students finished Ip Man and started watching Ong Bak 2

Kappy came back, this time he meant business! And died.
But they suddenly realized they had forgotten something important!They had forgotten their most important task, the dreaded SWE Exercise 2 was due in mere minutes...

After completing the exercise and finishing Ong Bak 2, they settled down on their couch to read the news.
The leading story this night was about the Chupacabra from Puerto Rico and its recent invasion of and killing the goats of Columbia, MO.

JSightings of exotic big cats in Australia began more than 100 years ago..he New South Wales State Government reported in 2003 that it was more likely than not that there was a colony of exotic big cats living in the bush near Sydney.

Several students, who wanted to help protect the livestocks, consulted the Beaman Monster professor.
The knowledgable professor then indicated that only one creature, the Ozark Howler, could defeat the the goat suckers.
The professor then rememberd that the majestic 'Ahool' could defeat the goat suckers as wellAfter remembering this very important fact, the professor took flight on his Ahool into the darkness to try and find the goat suckers!

Suddenly a Man-Eating Tree appeared and said to all of the students of CS 4320:
'This story makes no sense. Can we try again?' and began to tell the tale of his pet Malaysian Tiger, Tony.


 Tony had a girlfriend that was called a Globster.

The end.
